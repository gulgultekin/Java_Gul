    ALL RELATED WITH REQUIREMENTS

    Collection is parent of SET , LIST , QUEUE
    Collection is interface so can not create an object so we have to search
    for an implementation which implements collection

            Collection

    List --> Accept duplicates and also give the data however you wrote it

    SET --> Does not accept Duplicate and also can give the data randomly

    Vector --> it s look like ArrayList that it is dynamic array in which you can
    increase the size of a vector and we can increase the size of array
    advantage of using the vector is a dynamic array which means we can add elements
    increase the size automatically  v.capacity();  increase the capacity as per user requiremnts

    1st ->Difference between Arraylist increase the capacity by %50 ve vector increace the capacity by %100
    that help to manage the memory so Vector will keep lots of memory ,Arraylist save the memory

    VECTOR is __> Synchronized means thread safe  (one by one)
if thread safe means slow if it is not so it is fast so VECTOR -->is SLOW and also keep more MEMORY

    ARRAYLIST --> FAST (because we dont use Synchronized) and save the MEMORY   --> with get() method

    LINKLIST --> when you want to assign new the value[add()] between data linkedlist is MORE FASTER than Array list
    in case if search(fetch)[remove()] the value inside the data not like Arraylist using index so will be SLOW

    ArrayList --> when you want to assign new the value between data ArrayList is slower than Linklist
    in case of search(fetch) the item by index will be more easy for Arraylist so will be More FASTER than linklist

        //they are same just with some of the method they are acting more fast

    () is for function and methods
    {} is for definiton method or class definition
    [] is for Array
    <> angular bracets for generics
